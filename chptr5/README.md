Many variables:

"Every pair of variables has a statistically discernable non-zero correlation.". Correlations however do not translate to causation, thus it is necessary to find ways to "distinguish mere association from evidence of causation".

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), unlike a statisical model a DAG will give you an idea of what happens when you change a variable.
