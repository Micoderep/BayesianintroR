Many variables:

"Every pair of variables has a statistically discernable non-zero correlation.". Correlations however do not translate to causation, thus it is necessary to find ways to "distinguish mere association from evidence of causation".

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), unlike a statisical model a DAG will give you an idea of what happens when you change a variable.

The left image implies that all the variables depend on A and are all linked in someway. In the right it suggests that D is not dependent on M conditional on A. You can do an experiment to distinguish between these two DAG's by checking if D тлл M|A is true or not. Seeing correlations/associations is not enough because variables dependent on one can effect each other due to their dependence on said variable. "Knowing a cause in statistics means being able to correctly predict the consequences of an intervention."
